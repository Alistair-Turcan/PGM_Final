# PGM_Final

To run this code, open up either notebook, and simply run all the cells. It will perform the necessary simulations, do the parameter estimation, and give predictions at the end. We tried many things throughout this project, for the sake of simplicity we left the simplest, easiest to run examples in the current iterations of the code. The R code may take a while to run, it is mostly adapted from the unoptimized Darrous code.
